# AdquisitionSystem
This is the final project for the course: Logical Circuits.

The purpose of the project is to design and create a system that adquires data from external sensors, transform and display them via VGA. We are not concerned with the instrumentation part, only the design and implementation in FPGA. The project will be written in VHDL.
